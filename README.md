## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the analyzer:

```bash
npm start
```

Then select a game:
- Enter `1` or `osrs` for Old School RuneScape
- Enter `2` or `eve` for EVE Online

### OSRS Workflow

1. Select game (OSRS)
2. Choose whether to include member items (y/n)
3. Enter your investment budget (e.g., "2.5m", "500k", "10b")
4. Enter how many items to analyze (random sampling)
5. Wait for analysis (1 request per second to respect API limits)
6. View top 3 investment recommendations

### EVE Online Workflow

1. Select game (EVE Online)
2. Enter your ISK budget (e.g., "2.5b", "500m", "1000k")
3. Enter how many items to analyze (random sampling from all Jita items)
4. Wait for analysis (1 request per second to respect ESI API limits)
5. View top 3 investment recommendations with detailed metrics

## How It Works

### OSRS Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Fetches live item database from `https://chisel.weirdgloop.org/gazproj/gazbot/os_dump.json`
   - Fetches 180-day price history from `https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/api/graph/{itemId}.json`
2. **Filtering**:
   - Removes items without required data (price, volume)
   - Filters by membership status (F2P vs Members)
   - Excludes items where purchase would exceed GE buy limit (when limit exists)
   - Items without buy limit data are included (unlimited purchase potential)
   - Excludes items with insufficient volume (rejects if purchase > 10% of daily volume)
3. **Analysis**: Calculates multiple metrics:
   - Overall price change over 180 days
   - Price volatility (standard deviation as % of mean)
   - Recent momentum (30-day vs 60-day average comparison)
4. **Scoring**: Generates investment score (0-100) based on:
   - **High volatility** (20%+ volatility gets max points)
   - **Strong momentum** (positive short-term trends)
   - **Price movement** (40%+ price change favored)
   - **Affordability** (cheap items = buy more units)
   - Breakout patterns (bonus points)
5. **Recommendations**: Shows top 3 items ranked by investment score

### EVE Online Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetches all tradeable items in Jita from `https://esi.evetech.net/latest/markets/{regionId}/types/`
   - Resolves item names using `https://esi.evetech.net/latest/universe/names/`
   - Fetches market history from `https://esi.evetech.net/latest/markets/{regionId}/history/`
2. **Filtering**:
   - Excludes items with insufficient trading data
   - Ensures purchase amount doesn't exceed 10% of daily volume
   - Random sampling from all available items for analysis
3. **Analysis**: Calculates multiple metrics:
   - Overall price change over available history
   - Price volatility (standard deviation as % of mean)
   - Recent momentum (30-day vs 60-day average when sufficient data)
4. **Scoring**: Generates investment score (0-100) optimized for EVE markets:
   - **High volatility** (10%+ volatility gets max points)
   - **Strong momentum** (positive recent trends)
   - **Price movement** (recent upward trends favored)
   - **Affordability** (allows purchasing multiple units)
   - Hot item breakout bonuses
5. **Recommendations**: Shows top 3 items ranked by investment score

## Investment Strategy

Both analyzers target **high-volatility, high-ROI opportunities**:

### OSRS Strategy
- Looks for items with 40-50% return potential
- Favors volatile items (20%+ volatility)
- Prefers cheap items (can buy more units)
- Identifies momentum breakouts
- **NOT** a conservative strategy - this is for aggressive speculation

### EVE Online Strategy
- Focuses on high-volatility items (10%+ volatility threshold)
- Prioritizes positive momentum and recent price trends
- Considers market liquidity and trading volume
- Identifies breakout patterns for speculative trading
- **High-risk, high-reward** approach suitable for experienced traders

## Output Format

Both analyzers display top 3 recommendations with:
- Investment score (0-100)
- Current price (GP for OSRS, ISK for EVE)
- Units you can buy within budget
- Total investment cost
- Price change over analysis period
- Momentum score
- Volatility percentage (ðŸ”¥ emoji for high-volatility items)
- Daily trading volume
